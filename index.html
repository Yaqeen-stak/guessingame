                    TOP 10 random facts about me:
                </p>
                <ol id="facts">
                    <li>
                        I am an INFJ personality type, the rarest type.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I love to learn new things, and I embrace my inner nerd.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        People randomly spill their guts to me a lot in real life. Even strangers,
                        like in the line at the grocery store.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I always have a song stuck in my head.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I am left-handed, and I love it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I once took one of those personality tests that are supposed to tell you if you are left-brained
                        or right-brained.
                        I am exactly in the middle.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I search for meaning and purpose, even in small things.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I used to be a conflict-avoider, but no more.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I have a Tumblr Blog since 2011.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I love monkeys.
                    </li>
